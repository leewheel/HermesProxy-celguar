# Work in progress (Unusable in the current state)
This project is in very early stage of development. Currently it allows only to log in and see character list (which is broken).


## Description
This project continues HermesProxy work to enable play on legacy WoW servers cores the modern clients.

There are 4 major components to the application:
- The modern BNetServer (Supposedly updated).
- The legacy AuthClient (Supposedly updated). 
- The modern WorldServer (Totally broken). 
- The legacy WorldClient (Probably requires updates to support new features) (testing on AzerothCore).

Working to support those versions.

| Modern Versions | Legacy Versions |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| 3.4.3           | 3.3.5a          |

## Ingame Settings
Note: Keep `Optimize Network for Speed` **enabled** (it's under `System` -> `Network`), otherwise you will get kicked every now and then.

## Usage Instructions

- Edit the app's config to specify the exact versions of your game client and the remote server, along with the address.
- Go into your game folder, in the Classic or Classic Era subdirectory, and edit WTF/Config.wtf to set the portal to 127.0.0.1.
- Download [Arctium Launcher](https://github.com/Arctium/WoW-Launcher/releases/tag/latest) into the main game folder, and then run it  
  `--staticseed --version=Classic` for WotLK.
- Start the proxy app and login through the game with your usual credentials.
